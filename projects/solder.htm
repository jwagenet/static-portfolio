				<h3>Materials Science Comparison of Lead and Lead-Free Solder Compositions</h3>
				<!--Group: Jordan Briggs, Stefan Soezeri, Jonathan Wagenet-->
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Purpose</h2>
				<ul>Lead solders are increasingly regulated, suitable alternative solders should be explored. Basic solder alloying and testing within the scope of a lab project.</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Objectives</h2>
				<ul><li>Prepare a collection of Lead-Tin and Bismuth-Tin solder compositions</li>
				<li>Prepare phase diagrams for the two binary systems</li>
				<li>Perform microstructure analysis, shear testing, and wettability testing</li></ul>
			</section>

				<p>Constructed phase diagrams with experimental data in red over published phase diagrams for each binary tin alloy.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>				
				<h2>Procedure</h2>
				<ul><li>Prepared 5 different sample compositions of each the lead and bismuth solders.</li>
				<li>Used thermocouples and measurement software to take solder temperatures as they cooled.</li>
				<li>Polished 2 samples and inspected under a microscope to analyze structure.</li></ul>

			<section>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<ul><li>Composition preparation and phase diagram construction were successful. Able to mimic published data to a reasonable degree.</li>
				<li>Successful microstructure analysis under microscope, but no real conclusions.</li>
				<li>Shear and wettability tests were inconclusive.</li></ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Lessons and Challenges</h2>
				<ul><li>Melting solder compositions was  more difficult than anticipated, so a new method was needed.</li>
				<li>Better planning for test repeatability should be used, either with the equipment or methodology.</li>
				<li>In a repeated experiment, shear and wettability testing should be conducted with multiple trials on a single composition from each system rather than from multiple compositions for a larger sample size. </li></ul>
