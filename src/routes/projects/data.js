The spindleis driven by a stepper motor and is supported by an adjustable print support to level the surface. Delrin isthe selected print surface because of its good maintainability and thermal stability. The extruder is based ona filament feeder and hot end from the 3D printing community. I also designed an adjustable screw whichmounts on the x-axis rails which facilitates precise calibration of the z-axis homing position. Many partswere conceptually designed to be made from aluminum, but I redesigned them to be quickly made andtested with 3D printing. Additional parts like wiring clips and t-slot nuts were also made cheaply with PLA.Following assembling the mechanical structure, I took charge in testing and calibrating the electronics, andsetting up the controller software. 3D models and drawing is SolidWorks.</ul></section><section><h2>Issues and Improvements</h2><ul><li>Current design wraps cartesian models around surface. Tailored software may provide better results.</li><li>Current print cylinder is too heavy for driving motor, causing vibration and print imperfections.</li><li>No easy way to remove prints from the cylinder intact. Need to design surface to easily release print.</li><li>Add a y-axis back to the system for 4 axis printing and look into possible benefits of printing on a flatsurface using additional axes.</li></ul></section>"
